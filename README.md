# We've Got Herbes - Medicinal Plant Classifier

In the realm of natural medicine, accurate identification and understanding of medicinal herbs hold paramount importance. Our project, the Medicinal Herb Classifier (MHC), embodies a comprehensive solution leveraging machine learning. The MHC employs state-of-the-art algorithms to precisely identify diverse medicinal herbs based on their visual characteristics. This amalgamation of deep learning, an intuitive web interface, and an interactive chatbot forms a groundbreaking platform, enabling seamless herb recognition and dissemination of valuable herb-related information. From seasoned herbalists to curious enthusiasts, the MHC bridges the gap between traditional herbal knowledge and modern technology, empowering individuals with precise herb identification and access to informative resources.

## Key Features
### Deep Learning Model
- **Robust Classification:** Utilizes an advanced deep learning model trained on extensive datasets of medicinal herbs. The model, based on the Inception architecture, ensures precise herb classification from images, minimizing misclassification risks and the project utilizes a custom Inception model trained on a dataset of 190 classes of medicinal plants and leaves. The model is available in the 'inception.tflite' file.


### User-Friendly Web Interface
- **Seamless Upload and Identification:** An intuitive web interface allows users—herbalists, researchers, or enthusiasts—to effortlessly upload images of medicinal herbs. The system swiftly processes these images, providing instant and accurate identification results.

### Interactive Medicinal Herb Chatbot
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Repository:** Incorporates an AI-powered Medicinal Herb Chatbot. This intelligent bot addresses queries related to herb properties, medicinal uses, cultivation tips, and more. It acts as an interactive repository, delivering real-time information.

## Significance and Impact
This project bridges traditional herbal knowledge with modern technology, empowering accurate herb identification and effortless information access. It combines deep learning, an interactive interface, and natural language processing to facilitate herb recognition and serve as an educational platform.
